# Browser Fingerprint Protector

Available in [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/browser-fingerprint-protector/) and [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-fingerprint-prote/kcklikpoajnpdpjgamjfepagpdkhahpn).

## How it works

The extension protects the information in `window.navigator` and HTTP request headers to complicate browser fingerprinting.

- Completely hides `mimeTypes` and `plugins`.
- Pretends that you only have `English US` language.
- Pretends that you use `Windows 10`.

## How to validate that it works

- [whoer.net](https://whoer.net/) is a good way to see what browser is leaking. Ignore the "anonymity percentage", focus on the information that it is able to retrieve, such as languages, user agent, plugins, etc.
- [Most Common User Agents](https://techblog.willshouse.com/2012/01/03/most-common-user-agents/) is a website that shows the current most common user agent. It is expected that with this extension your browser is listed among the first few entries in the table.
